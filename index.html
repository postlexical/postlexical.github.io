        </table>
        <p>Blackstone, the enormous hedge fund & private equity group, is under constant scrutiny for scandalous investments. After the 2008 financial crisis, Blackstone expanded its commercial landlord business by buying up foreclosed homes, driving up rents and refusing to do maintenance. It has financed the burning of the Amazon rainforest. Blackstone owns Motel 6, and had to settle lawsuits in 2018 & 2019 for turning their customers over to ICE. UN officials have criticized Blackstone's use of "aggressive" evictions fueling the housing and homelessness crises. Blackstone's founder & CEO is a major Trump donor and serves as his policy advisor. They donated $5 million dollars to the Business Roundtable, which in turn has spent nearly $9 million fighting Prop 15.</p>

        <p>This research and advocacy association seems to have a penchant for anti-working class ballot measures. From donating to No on Prop 21 (rent control) to supporting Prop 22 (Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash’s million-dollar attempt to prevent gig workers from unionizing and avoid paying these workers a basic minimum wage, benefits, sick pay, and unemployment insurance), this group knows who it is advocating for. Our guess? The Fortune 500 companies that partially fund them.</p>

        </table>
        <p>Chevron gave a half million dollars this year to the Business Roundtable, which has made stopping Prop 15 its top priority. Why? We’re guessing it has to do with Chevron getting a $100 million/year tax break from the loophole Prop 15 closes. Chevron is notorious for running Richmond as a company town for its refinery for 100+ years, dodging taxes and dumping pollution on the working class, majority POC city & their own workers with impunity. Paying up now would only begin to undue the damage they’ve done locally, let alone globally.</p>

        <p>Jeffrey Palmer is a real estate investor/developer and is a partner at PMI properties which that has investments in “over $500 million in office, shopping center, industry and apartment properties” located in Los Angeles County and San Francisco. The spaces that PMI operates are large, commercial spaces that would be (finally) taxed fairly if Prop 15 passes, which might explain why 500 million dollar Jeff is so opposed to Prop 15. He also credits his company with “reviv[ing] the struggling SOMA district” in San Francisco by leasing out office space to companies like Twitter and Eventbrite. We didn’t need gentrifying landlords to “save” San Francisco, but Jeff could do us a solid by paying his taxes and reviving our struggling public schools and services!</p>

Unite HERE, the hotel workers union, put a measure on the ballot in 2019 requiring hotels to provide their workers with a panic button to summon help if they're sexually assaulted at work, and to guarantee them a minimum living wage. Terranea spent $1 million fighting the panic button measure and won.</p>

        <p>A big player on the $1.2 billion dollar prison telecom market, this company has made a pretty penny off mass incarceration across almost 2,300 facilities. As jails have suspended visitations due to COVID-19, Global Tel Link (GTL) is said to have come up with lucrative schemes to offer “free phonecalls” by pressuring inmates to deposit more money into their platform. The company is also expected to generate $8.8 million through a similar “free tablets” program, which distributes tablets to inmates while charging them for each email sent. Added to this exploitative pattern, the company sells intelligence services to prison facilities, gathering data from phonecalls and using analytical software to, in their own words, “transform raw data from any structured source into actionable intelligence that can be used to solve crimes that have occurred or to reduce the potential for future crime.”.</p>

    <h4><b>What is Prop 15? How should I vote on Prop 15?</b></h4>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.yes15.org/?utm_source=YesOn15.org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=yes_on_15_org">Proposition 15 - The Schools and Communities First Act</a> is a ballot initiative that would tax wealthy corporations like Disney and reclaim approximately $12 billion dollars a year for working class communities. As it currently stands, wealthy corporations in California pay property taxes based not on the market value of their properties, but rather on the price they paid to purchase it originally, meaning that many corporations are paying property taxes that are over 50 years out of date. By avoiding paying the full value of their properties, these corporations have robbed our state and communities of tens of billions of dollars that should have been invested into resources for our schools and communities. By closing this tax loophole and charging wealthy owners of commercial properties with assessed value over $3 million to pay taxes based on market value rather than purchase price, Prop 15 will reclaim $10-12 billion annually and allocate those funds to K-12 public schools, community colleges, and local public services such as parks, libraries, homeless services, health clinics, and public transit.
<br><br>
The economic disaster triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic combined with renewed calls for racial justice makes voting Yes on Prop 15 an urgent matter. Prop 15 will direct much needed resources to working-class communities of color that for too long have been underserved and underfunded. The capitalist class continues to hoard absurd levels of profit while California schools, services and the community suffer, but we can begin to put a stop to that with a Yes on Prop 15. Now is the time to tax the rich to fund our schools and services. Vote Yes on Proposition 15!

<h4><b>Who supports Prop 15?</b></h4>
    <p>Proposition 15 is supported by nurses, teachers, parents, small business owners, homeowners and renters, and local elected officials managing cash-strapped budgets. From the California Federation of Teachers to the California Nurses Association, Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice to Senior and Disability Action and California’s ACLU, Yes on Prop 15 brings together a rich diversity of Californians dedicated to the well-being of their communities. 
<br><br>
Socialists organizing in Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) are working hand-in-hand with labor unions to win Prop 15. This coalitional effort, Labor for Prop 15, is primarily led by UAW 2865, the union that represents Tutors, Readers, Graduate Student Instructors and Teaching Assistants at the University of California. Other local unions involved in Labor for Prop 15 involve UPTE-CWA, UAW Local 5810, UTLA, OEA, and SEIU Local 1021. Together, Labor for Prop 15 will be hosting phonebanks for fifteen consecutive days as we approach election day.

	</p>
	<h4><b>Who opposes Prop 15?</b></h4>
    <p>Wealthy real-estate developers, fossil fuel companies, country clubs and golf clubs are spending millions of dollars to make sure that their tax loopholes are safe. Corporations like Chevron, Blackstone, and Paramount Group, Inc. are donating to No on Prop 15, hoping that Californians do not come for their coffers to fund much needed public services like schools and libraries.
	</p>
	<h4><b>Who made this website? How can I learn more about DSA and get involved in DSA for Prop 15?</b></h4>
    <p>This website was made by members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). DSA is a member-run socialist organization in the United States. We believe that working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few. This website was created solely by volunteers in our Californian DSA chapters as a contribution to the inspiring attempt by workers and community members to pass legislation that would allow for the biggest reclamation of wealth for working class Californians in decades.
<br><br>
We want a world run for the benefit of people, not profit. We believe in real democracy, which means ordinary working people having democratic control over the economy and their own lives. We pick big fights that will benefit working people, like <a target="_blank" href="https://medicareforall.dsausa.org/">Medicare for All</a> and the battle for real rent control; we support strong, democratic labor unions; and we back democratic socialist political candidates like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jovankaforactransit.com/">Jovanka Beckles</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://jackieforsenate.com/">Jackie Fielder</a>. And we have fun doing it!
